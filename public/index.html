    <div class="information">
      Trove is a New York City-based theatre and live arts collective. Trove is
      a rejection of the scarcity mindset in favor of lightness, community, and
      the belief that we already have everything we need. Trove is having fun
      while making radical, delightful, really good art with and for the people
      we love. <span id="trove-forever">Trove forever!</span>

      Our first Treasure is Drive the Speed Limit, written by Penelope Gould and
      directed by Marina Carlstroem.
      <br />
      Drive the Speed Limit is a play about Eve, a chronically ill and fat
      teenager struggling to understand her body while navigating her artist
      mother and wacky grandmother’s opposing views of what it looks and feels
      like to be healthy.
      <br />
      Moving between the doctor’s office, school, and home in the passenger
      seat, Eve sifts through her days while in pain.
      <br />
      Shadow puppets animate what is going on in her body, making this battle
      visible.
      <br />
      Everyone responds to Eve’s sickness in their own way. Her mother is unable
      to find her artistic spark.
      <br />
      Her grandmother dives deeper into her faith. The doctors don’t accept her
      insurance.
